# Connections

Connections is a social network API that is built for a social network web application. Using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM, this API is structured so that users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 

## Getting Started

This application requires Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose packages. Download the files and install dependencies. To seed data to your database, run node utils/seed.
